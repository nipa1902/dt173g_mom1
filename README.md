# dt173g_mom1

## This is the readme-file for the first moment of the web course DT173G, written by Nils Paulsson (nipa1902). 

### Part 1: Markdown, introduction

#### In this part of the course, we are learning how to use GitHub, readme-files, GitHub Pages and Markdown. We also have produced a report for answering a number of theoretical questions about how Git works!

This readme file is written with the use of [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org). [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/) is a simple way of using basic markup syntax, like in HTML, to create beautiful text. The idea is to keep the text as readable as possible. For this reason, Markdown syntax is quite simple. It supports text that is **bold**, *italic*, or even ***both***! But it also does a lot more. For instance, let's make a list of things Markdown can do:

* Create unordered lists
* Make text pretty 
* Allow for links to [nice places](http://www.csszengarden.com/)

1. Make lists that are ordered
2. **Make bold entries to lists**
3. Put &copy;Nils Paulsson into a list

### Part 2: Markdown, continued

Markdown generates HTML from the text input. So for example, we create paragraph elements by simply creating new lines of text.

This allows us to type in a way that's more natural and readable, much more like a standard text editor than a coding or markup language. Sometimes, you may prefer line breaks.  
No worries. Markdown permits this too. 

### Part 3: Blockquotes and Code Blocks

    To make a code block, we simply indent our lines
    You know, like in a code editor?
    Ain't that swell?
  
>For a blockquote, you'll want to use these characters<br>
>The little arrows, or greater-than markers<br>
>To be honest, I'm not sure I find them *that* great<br>
>But hey, you can always use line breaks for poetic verses

### Part 4: Goodbye

This repo is quite empty at the moment. That's okay. We'll think of things to do later. Eventually, we'll have our own little RESTful service using PHP. How cool is that?
For now, I should go. If you want to learn more about Markdown Syntax, why not click [here](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/ "Markdown Guide: Basic Syntax"). That link even has a title! Wow!
